The candidates will each give a presentation of no more than 20 minutes.
Selection of questions
Each Member State joining the virtual forum may ask questions if it so wishes.
After each candidate has made an oral presentation, the Chair will pick the tokens randomly, one-by-
one, until the time available is exhausted. After each token is drawn, the corresponding Member States will be invited to ask a question, and the candidate invited to provide an answer.
Questions and Answers
Member States will have up to one minute to ask one question only. Multiple part questions will not be permitted. Candidates will have up to three minutes to respond to each question. Each interview will conclude when the 40 minutes for the interview have elapsed, even if there are pending questions.

Timekeeping
A clock will be displayed on the screen to assist the participants to keep within the time limits during both parts of the interview.
